/* Your Task

Implement the following classes: Pet, Cat, and Dog.
Pet Class

    constructor(owner, name) - should have these 3 properties:

        owner - string

        name - string

        comments - array

    addComment(comment):

This function should receive a single comment as a string, add it to the comments array and return a message:

"Comment is added."

If the same comment was already added to the comments array, throw an error:

"This comment is already added!"

    feed():

This function should return a simple message:

"{name} is fed`

    toString():

This function should return a string:

"Here is {owner}'s pet {name}."

If there are any comments then add them on a new line:

"Special requirements: {comment1}, {comment2}, {comment3 ...}"
Cat Class

The Cat class inherits from Pet.

It should have these 4 properties:

    owner - string

    name - string

    insideHabits - string

    scratching - boolean

    feed():

This function should inherit the feed() method of the Pet class and extend the returned message adding this to the end of the same line:

", happy and purring."

    toString():

This function should extend the toString() method of the Pet class, returning the message with some more lines at the end, which are:

"Main information:
{name} is a cat with {insideHabits}"

And if the value of the scratching pr–æperty is true you should add this at the end:

", but beware of scratches."

Note: For more information, see the examples below!
Dog Class

The Dog class inherits from Pet.

    constructor(owner, name, runningNeeds, trainability) - it should have these 4 properties:

        owner - string

        name - string

        runningNeeds - string

        trainability - string

    feed():

This function should inherit the feed() method of the Pet class and extend the returned message, adding this at the end:

", happy and wagging tail."

    toString():

This function should extend the toString() method of the Pet class returning the message with some more lines at the end, which are:

"Main information:
{name} is a dog with need of {runningNeeds}km running every day and {trainability} trainability."

Note: For more information, see the examples below!
